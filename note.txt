you cant open ts and js in the same window

"tsc --target es2015 hello.ts" for compile in specific js version

tsc --noEmitOnError hello.ts for no emit to js on error

TYPE VS INTERFACE
type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

! = non null,,,, ex. square.radius! ** 2
? = optional,,,, ex. circle.radius? : number
